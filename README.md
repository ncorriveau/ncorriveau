- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nicko!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data science and machine learning engineering. 
- Iâ€™m currently attending Columbia Engineering pursuing my MS in Operations Research and focusing on Machine Learning and Analytics. Outside of school and work, I like to watch soccer (huge arsenal fan) and spend time outdoors. 
- I'm particularly interested in predictive modeling in financial and medical applications. 
- ðŸ“« You can reach out to me nc2942@columbia.edu if you'd like to get in touch.
