- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nicko! Iâ€™m interested in data science/engineering and Machine Learning. Iâ€™m currently attending Columbia Engineering pursuing my MS in Operations Research while working for mParticle as a data engineer. My focus in school has been on Machine Learning (Deep Learning/NLP/Predictive Modeling) as well as various courses in math and CS. You can reach out to me nc2942@columbia.edu if you'd like to get in touch.
